# ML.NET Training


## What is ML.NET?
>ML.NET is an open-source machine learning framework that makes it simpler for C# developers to build and deploy machine learning models.

## Three main categories of machine learning models
* Supervised Learning (SL)
  - Learning involves training a model on *labeled data*, where each data point is associated with a known outcome. 
  - The goal of supervised learning is to use this *labeled data* to build a model that can accurately predict outcomes for new, unlabeled data.
  - A key benefit of supervised learning is that it can be used to build models for a wide range of applications.
  - **Labeled data** refers to a dataset that has been assigned one or more categories or labels.
  - Commonly used **algorithms**
    - Linear regression
    - Logistic regression
    - Decision trees
* Usupervised Learning:
  - Training a model on unlabeled data to find patterns or structures within the data.
  - Some applications of unsupervised learning include:
    - **Clustering** allows you to automatically split the dataset into groups according to similarity. 
    - **Anomaly detection** can automatically discover unusual data points in your dataset. 
    - **Association mining** identifies sets of items that frequently occur together in your dataset.
    - **Latent variable models** are commonly used for data preprocessing, such as reducing the number of features in a dataset (dimensionality reduction) or decomposing the dataset into multiple components.

* Semi-supervised
  - Larning combines labeled and unlabeled data to train a model.
